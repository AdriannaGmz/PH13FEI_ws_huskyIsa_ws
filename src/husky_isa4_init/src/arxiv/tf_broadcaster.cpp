/** Broadcaster of tf tree that relates 

 * lidar readings (from its own coordinate system base_lidar) 
 * to the base_link (origin/base coordinate system of husky)

base_lidar is located x: -0.232m, y: 0.138m, z: 1.057m from the base_link of the husky

Node that publishes the base_lidar â†’ base_link transform over ROS.
